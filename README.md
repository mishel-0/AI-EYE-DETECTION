# AI-EYE-DETECTION
AI-Powered Eye Disease Detection

This is a **FastAPI-based backend** for detecting **eye diseases** from medical images using a **pretrained deep learning model**. It takes an image as input, processes it using a **CNN-based AI model**, and returns the predicted disease category along with confidence scores.  

## **Features**  
- Upload eye scan images for AI-based disease detection.  
- Uses a **pretrained CNN model** to classify eye diseases like **diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts**.  
- Returns **prediction results** with confidence scores.  
- Built using **FastAPI**, making it lightweight and efficient.
